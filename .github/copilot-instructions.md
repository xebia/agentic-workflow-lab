## Project Context

This is a learning lab for GitHub Copilot's context engineering features. The Task Manager CLI serves as a simple, practical example application for demonstrating how to effectively use custom instructions, custom agents, and prompt files to guide AI-assisted development.

## Key Principles

- Keep the implementation simple and focused on core functionality
- Follow the layered architecture pattern (CLI → Business Logic → Data Persistence)
- Write clear, maintainable C++ code following the style guide
- Ensure all changes are tested and work correctly
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
